    Figwrapper
</h1>
    
`Figwrapper` is a script that integrates the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) design tool (web version) generated by [nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier) into a complete, fully integrated application for Linux. It uses the [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) wrapper generated, which is further customized, to behave like a proper Linux app.

    Why not just use nativefier?
</h1>

Convenience. Because I use it a lot and wanted a full Linux integration and automated install. Figwrapper offers improvement over the generated nativefier files, transforms it into a full, proper Linux application, allows for a quicker workflow due to it's full Linux integration, with proper Linux standard file system paths, system-wide icon and executable binary, proper .desktop. You can manipulate it the way you want through terminal commands, scripts, dmenu/rofi calls, etc and with your WM of choice as well. A systray funcionality/icon is also possible, but currently there is no feature planned for it, therefore it's disabled by default.

It behaves exactly as if you had installed it through your distro's package manager.
